# Docker and Python
For this assignment you will be combining Docker with Python to create a program that generates a QR code PNG file that contains a URL. The QR code can be viewed with the camera on your phone to allow a user to click on it and send them to the target website. You must make your program generate a QR code that takes someone to your GitHub homepage

# Setup
